# Usage

To use the web app, the required files are need to have been downloaded or cloned. **(Refer to the GIT section in Getting Started).**

To run the app follow these steps:

1. Open your file explorer or press `Ctrl + E`.

2. Navigate to where you cloned the folder in this [step](#using-ssh).

3. Right-click on the folder.

4. Click on `Open with Application` and select `Visual Studio Code`.**(The location of these buttons may vary depending on your Operating System)**

5. Open a new terminal by doing `Ctrl + Shift + backtick` or on the title bar select `Terminal` and the select `New Terminal`.

```

![install & start](public/resources/npm_dev.png 'Npm install & start')

8. While holding `Ctrl` click on the blue link `http://localhost:5173`, this should open the web app on the default browser. **_You can copy the link and paste in your preferred browser._**

<mark>**_Note:_**</mark> If there is something else running on port 5173 the program will automatically use another port another port e.g port 5174.

## JSON Server Setup

To run this challenge you will need a [Mock API](https://web.archive.org/web/20220712163343/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MockServer) (Application Programming Interface) or Mock server to create an [API](https://web.archive.org/web/20230730192208/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) to fetch/get data from.

To start using JSON Server, we need to install it.

Without closing the terminal, on the right side click the `+` icon on the top right of the terminal to create a new terminal.

![Plus icon](public/resources/plus_icon.png 'Plus Icon')

1. First check if NPM(Node Package Manager) is already installed:

```bash
npm -v
```

Make sure that the number displayed is greater than 9 or better is the latest. **If so continue to step 2**

<mark>**Note:**</mark> To download the latest version of npm, run the following command on the terminal:

```bash
npm install -g npm
```

2. To start JSON Server, run the following command in the terminal in VSCode. In our case the [name].json is db.json and make sure the [name].db is in that directory.

```bash
json-server --watch src/data/db.json
```

When run, you'll see some messaging about how to access our JSON data. By default, JSON Server will start up on port 3000. You should see a notice that you can access the server at http://localhost:3000. **_Refer [here](#‚ö†-common-errors) if you encounter any errors._**

![JSON Server](public/resources/json_server.png 'JSON Server running')

**For more information about JSON Server checkout their [homepage.](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)**

<mark>**_Note_ :**</mark> **Leave the Terminal open for the server to continue running in the background**

In the browser the page should look like this:

![Bot Battlr App](public/resources/BB_app.png 'Bot Battlr App')

![Bot Army App](public/resources/BB_army_app.png 'Bot Battlr App')

<mark>**_Note_ :**</mark>

- If you encounter any errors refer [here](#‚ö†-common-errors).
- Pressing the `X` on the terminal does not kill any process it just hides. To show the `terminal` press `Ctrl + backtick`

# ‚ö† Common Errors

![Npm Error](public/resources/npm_error.png 'Check your command')

1. This error signals that the npm command you run is not correct for the project it should be:

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. If the website loads but the styling if off check if you have an ad-blocker (U-Block) or a network monitor that is blocking the styling.

3. If the page loads without any data check the path the json server is watching or check if there is a `db.json` in the current directory.<br> If this happens json server creates automatically default data and a db.json to go with it in that directory
